# TenkoCript

This is an artifact from when I was a little teenager programmer.

One of my first "programs", committed almost without modifications (I needed to change few lines to make it compile on MacOs).

It's an elementary implementation of the [Cesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher), written in "C++".

I love the innocence transparing from the source code, the Italian variable names, the dubious FAQ and instructions.

Thanks to @atzenigor for preserving this gem all these years.

## Compile and run on MacOS

```sh

# Ignore the warnings
g++ TenkoCript.cpp -o TenkoCript

./TenkoCript
```
